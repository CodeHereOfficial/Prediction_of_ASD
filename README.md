# Prediction_of_ASD
<h1>PREDICTING AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER using machine learning</h1>
<h3>Problem Statement : </h3>
<p>With the available ASD data on individuals the goal is to perform comparative analysis of different algorithms and come up with the best one  to create a model  which will make predictions regarding new patients and classify them into one of two categories: “patient has ASD” or “patient does not have ASD “. </p>
<h3>Hardware Requirements :</h3><ul>
<li>Central processing unit(CPU) – Intel core i5 6th generation processor or higher.</li>
<li>Ram – 8Gb minimum, 16Gb or higher is recommended.</li>
<li>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) – NVIDIA GeForce GTX960 or higher.</li>
<li>Operating System – Windows 10. 
</li>

</ul>
<h3>Software Requirements :</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anaconda</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Keras</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methodology :</h3>
<p>We have used supervised machine learning for creating a model that learns from data, i.e., there is a set of data labeled with the correct answer for the model to learn from. This work aims to explore several competing supervised machine learning classification techniques namely:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Decision Trees</li>
<li>Random Forests</li>
<li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
<li>k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)</li>
<li>Naive Bayes</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</li>
<li>Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)</li>
</ol>
